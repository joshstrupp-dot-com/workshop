        "There are moments in these deportation fights when I can just FEEL how pissed off they are that I\u2019m Puerto Rican \ud83d\ude02 they want to threaten me with it so bad \ud83d\ude02",
        "Young lady...as an old white guy, you two are the reason I still have hope! Bless you and stay strong and safe\ud83d\udc97",
        "Amazing powerful women-I am so here for this!",
        "They have literally zero power and are basically just nurses to octagenarians",
        "Keep fighting, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez! We need your voice. Be safe! Seriously. \u270a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc99",
        "Couldnt agree more, Angele! \ud83d\udc99",
        "As a white guy, I say stuff around other white guys like, \"you know, not once in my life has a person of color ever ruined my life\". You'd be amazed how many times this sends some off the rails. Anyway, racism still has a lot to do with where our country is today.",
        "You just say that randomly? Thats kinda weird.",
        "I am weird.",
        "I\u2019m Puerto Rican and Mexican and I\u2019m in constant fear. I was born in San Diego my parents are also born in America as were my grandparents. Before them I do not know. Yet I am constantly reminded that I could be next. When I see them target Navajos and green card holders.",
        "Stay strong. We have to do this together and I am one who, if I see anything happening in front of me, will get involved to help.",
        "It\u2019s always a positive to know that people will say something. I just worry that people will become complacent. I currently live in Columbus Ga and I have a lot of maga people everywhere. It scares me. I try not to let it control my life. When all of this started I was scared to step outside.",
        "Georgia is a hard place to be right now I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m in Virginia which is more mixed but we have enough for sure.",
        "Yes all we can do is come together. Hopefully they see how wrong they are. Hopefully they\u2019ll join hands with us. However when your heart is filled with hatred and bigotry all you see is a world full of enemies. You\u2019d rather suffer so others can go without. They feel zero empathy very apathetic.",
        "I love you.",
        "I love you both \ud83d\udc95",
        "We got your back AOC. #UNITEANDFIGHT",
        "That's cool and inspiring, but they also have military grade weapons, tanks and drones. People will die.",
        "Revolutions aren\u2019t won by sitting around telling people to not do anything. They will not wipe out the entire population either- they need us to survive; not the other way around. We outnumber the military and billionaire class put together- I understand risk but I also understand logic.",
        "I wasn't suggesting that people do nothing, only that they pretty pictures are an illusion. They are working very hard to not need the masses - bots and drones, etc. It is a different war and we need different strategies because dying in the street probably isn't good enough.",
        "That\u2019s an even better reason to get motivated- the longer we sit in the boiling pot, the worse it gets- including replacing us altogether. We have an opportunity right now to stop this shit timeline. No disrespect my friend- I hope my passion isn\u2019t coming across as snarky.",
        "Not at all. I get passionate as well. I am a Cassandra -- so I'm used to being told I'm over reacting. I would contrast this meme with the famous one from Trenaman Square - one man standing up to tanks. Noble, but the tanks won. What will mass protest do....and how?",
        "This isn't Havel's Velvet Revolution. Scale is significantly different. Also, Havel had an idea (a real political theory) and a plan and he achieved it over time. That doesn't exist in the protest these days. (Tiananmen Square, I meant.) Act - of course, act.",
        "But we are in for a long fight, so also think, and plan and co-ordinate because what comes out of this is not going to be the same as it was going in.",
        "Just remember that Chauvin was convicted. I'm old enough and white enough to know that might not have happened without all the marches. And it happened despite T and maga doing everything possible to prevent it.",
        "congresswoman you stand tall and strong for your community and for the people that elected you in there you have been threatened yes but you wont back down we need everyone else to follow you and fight back against the evil nazi trump administration enough is enough get it done drag trump out now!!!",
        "They lash out because they hate a strong woman who is not afraid to speak out against this ongoing coup created by Putin.",
        "AOC please keep fighting millions of Americans are counting on you!",
        "Of course you\u2019re right\u2026that\u2019s why they are threatening you. They KNOW that you know EXACTLY what their intentions are\u2026we appreciate how you show up for the country and her people! \ud83d\udc99",
        "Give \u2018em hell!",
        "They are gd racists. Keep doing you.",
        "But we should remember this isn't silliness or inconsistency. It's racism. They know you're an American, they don't *want* you to be. Fascists want nothing more than to be able to selectively declare citizens \"illegal\".",
        "You go, girl. By that I mean YOU STAY, GIRL.",
        "You have to be real truthful to yourself right now. This is happening! We are under attack. None of these maneuvers are to benefit Americans, which is the sole purpose for electing a president or leader.",
        "Please, Ms. Cortez, watch your back. They are not just pissed off, they itch to make an example of, what they would love to do to all people of colour... And you are - let's face it - a very big thorn in their paws \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude18 And thank you for that from little Denmark \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0",
        "Not only because you\u2019re Puerto Rican, but even worse, you are a woman! Of color! And not obeying! Defying, challenging, and making a White guy look like the stupid, bigoted bully that he is!",
        "And don\u2019t forget SMART and BRAVE",
        "That speaks for itself",
        "Dump probably still thinks that the president of Puerto Rico should be helping their country.",
        "You KNOW they have said it to each other! \ud83d\ude02 There\u2019s nothing more frightening to their big, fat, blubbery white selves than a woman who is easily poised to reveal how mid they really are\u2026.",
        "Puerto Rico is a beautiful island with wonderful people.",
        "You are also strong, smart, beautiful and courageous. Let them be pissed. We love everything about you",
        "Yet YOU and others have proven to be more American than any MAGA.",
        "Imagine their chagrin when you become president.",
        "And a good portion of this country will ve SHOCKED when they find out Puerto Ricans are actually American citizens.",
        "'Pissed' about your Puerto Rican roots. FEARFUL that you are a strong and super intelligent woman, that doesn't take shit.",
        "57 year old Brit here I think you may the last vestige of hope 100% backing you",
        "You are, just like they are, an American. Period. What they're actually threatened by? You are brilliant in your delivery of complex thought processes, making things clear when the rest of us listen to you. A true gift that is! And you know what? They possess None & I mean Zero of that! \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Puerto Rican women are the perfect humans. We also fight like caciques. Viva Boriken!",
        "You just know they wana call you a slur lol",
